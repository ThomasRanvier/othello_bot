In this report I present my implementation of the Alpha Beta algorithm for the Othello game.

This implementation uses Java, in the first part it is explained how to run the program.
The program uses an iterative deepening Alpha Beta algorithm, the implementation details are presented, the details of the heuristics function are then also presented.
The program has been tested in both configurations using time limits between 1 and 10 seconds, my progam beats the naive program every time.
