I slightly modified the `othellostart' script, it is now placed above the `naive' repository that contains the naive code, the way to use it is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./othellostart .script_1 .script_2 t
\end{lstlisting}

Where `.script\_1' and `.script\_2' can correspond either to `./naive/othello' or `./java/othello' depending on the game disposition that you chose.
The variable `t' corresponds to the time limit that you want to set.

So for example if you want to see a fame between the naive as white and my implementation as black for a limit time of 2 seconds this is the command to enter:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./othellostart ./naive/othello ./java/othello 2
\end{lstlisting}

I also created two scripts, `playblack' and `playwhite' that you can directly use with the time limit as parameter if you want my program to compete against the naive one playing black or white.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./playwhite t
./playblack t
\end{lstlisting}
