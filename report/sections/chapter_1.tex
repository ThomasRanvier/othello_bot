To run my code you have to use the `othellostart' script and put in parameters the two scripts that you want to use, the first one is the white player, the second one is the black player, the variable `t' is the time limit.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./othellostart .script_1 .script_2 t
\end{lstlisting}
