I initially implemented the Alpha Beta algorithm using Python 3.
My implementation worked but for a reason that I was not able to find, even with the help of another student the program was incredibly slow, in mid game it was not able to reach a depth of 7 under almost 20 seconds.

After a while I decided to simply reimplement the exact same program using Java and the program was then able to reach a depth of 7 under half a second at any point in the game.

This was the main issue that I encountered, after switching to Java I had no other difficulties.
