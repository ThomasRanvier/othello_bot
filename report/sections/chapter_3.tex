To evaluate my program performances against the naive program I made them fight against each other using both possible compositions and time limits between 1 and 10 seconds, those are the results obtained using the final heuristic function described in this report.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ c | c c c c c c c c c c } 
        Time limit & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\\
        \hline
        Score as white & 36 & 56 & 54 & 54 & 52 & 58 & 54 & 54 & 54 & 58\\
        Score as black & 54 & 60 & 54 & 62 & 62 & 42 & 44 & 48 & 46 & 46\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

As we can see with those results, no matter the time limit my program beats the naive program very easily.
