Othello program
--------------------------
This repository contains the folders java and naive.
In those are repectively my java implementation of the alpha beta algorithm for the Othello game and the initial given implementation.

To start the game using two different bots you have to use the following command:
> othellostart .script\_1 .script\_2 x

Here script\_1 and script\_2 can either be /java/othello or /naive/othello depending on your choice.

The value x corresponds to the chosen time limit.
