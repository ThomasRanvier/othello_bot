Othello program
--------------------------
This repository contains the folders java and naive.
In those are repectively my java implementation of the alpha beta algorithm for the Othello game and the initial given implementation.

To start the game with my bot playing black or white against the naive one you can either use:

> playblack t

or

> playwhite t

With t being the time limit.

If you want to choose yourself the two scripts to use you can use the following command:

> othellostart .script\_1 .script\_2 t

Here script\_1 and script\_2 can either be /java/othello or /naive/othello or another script depending on your choice.

The value t corresponds once again to the chosen time limit.
